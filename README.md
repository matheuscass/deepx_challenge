# Answer to Handwritten Character Recognition challenge

Here is my answer to Handwritten Character Recognition challenge. I've basically trained a neural net (CNN) using EMNIST dataset to translate images of handwritten digits into characters.

## Getting Started

For this task, I've used Python 3.6 and Keras. To run the solution, you must have both installed.

### Reading Images

To get started, put your image files in read_images folder. There are already 7 files in it. To make the inference, just run:

```
python inference.py
```
There is already a trained model in deepx_challenge folder, so you don't have to train the net before making inference. For more details of the code, open inference.py file with IDLE or Spyder.

### Training

Open train.ipynb file using Jupyter Notebook to see step-by-step how the CNN model was trained. Run all cells to train the model again.

So, I think that's it! I hope these simple instructions were clear and sufficient! Thanks for the opportunity!
